                 A major part of engineering consists of problem solving and by this event, we test just that in the
                 participants.
                 The participants will be given a circuit with a minor fault and they will have to debug the problem and
                 make the circuit work.
                 Analyzing networks and putting theoretical knowledge into a practical scenario is the main focus of
                 this event.
                <br>
                This event of debugging hardware consists of two rounds.
                <br>
                First round is written test, which is based on
                electronic circuits.
                <br>

                The shortlisted participants for final round will be given circuits with bugs on some simulation
                software’s and need to debug the same.
                <br>
                1. Max 2 in a team.
                <br>
                2. First round is of duration 45 mins.
                <br>
                3. Second round duration is 60 mins.
                <br>
                4. No provision for resources like internet, calculator, books, mobile phones.
