                  Fumble and it’s all over!! Trace it and track the prize!!! This event is for the code masters. Here’s your chance to
                  prove your robot’s worth. A series of simple yet complex lines are to be traced by the autonomous robot. Build the
                  right circuit and test the precision of your programming. As the saying goes, “You don’t fall out of track and you
                  shall emerge victorious", stay on line and pave the path to success!!!

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <br>
            A line tracker is an autonomous machine which senses a given line and tracks it. This mechanism turns up as an
            application in the real time in performing different redundant industrial tasks (say point to point
            transportation/identification).
            
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

            <br>


            An autonomous line tracking robot has to be made, which can traverse a path that runs through junctions, breaks,
            unusual curves and pointed angles. The machine should follow the line without deviating from it.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h2>Dimensional specifications</h2>

            <br>

            The robot should fit in a cube of 20 cm side and weight is at choice.
            Control specifications
            The robot should be autonomous.
            Power specifications
            The robot should have on-board power supply and voltage between any two points on the robot should not exceed 12V.
            Note: A tolerance of 5% is allowed in the above mentioned dimensional and power specifications, taking into
            consideration the error of the measuring instruments that we use here and those used by the participants in the making
            of the robot.

            Arena Description
            1. The base of the arena is made up of white coloured flex sheet on which black coloured line is printed or can be
            pasted.
            2. The thickness of the line will be 3cm (0.5cm tolerance).
            3. The course line may have pointed angles (not less than 300), curves of radius as small as 5cm and junctions.
            The Event
            The event will be conducted in two rounds each of increasing complexity, among which the first will be the qualifying
            round.
            Qualifying Round
            In this round the basic line following mechanism is tested. The robot should reach the end point without deviating from
            the line. It is mandatory to clear the qualifying round to progress for the further rounds. A maximum of two trials
            (changes can be made by coordinators at the time of event) are given to each team.
            Final Round
            The robot should begin from the start point and reach the end point. Similar to the qualifying round the path consists
            of junctions, curves, misleading paths. The entire path should be traversed by the robot to progress into the final
            round. >> If the bot stops automatically a bonus of -15 seconds will be added to the final time. >> Arena for the final
            round will not be revealed until the day of the event. This round may have very sharp curves, loops, misleading
            junction’s discontinuities etc., Similar to the Qualifying round the course line is black and made on white coloured
            flex sheet.
            RULES AND REGULATIONS:
            1. A maximum of 4 participants are allowed in a team.
            2. The Robot should be completely autonomous. It should not receive any sort of external assistance.
            3. No Lego kits or Vega kits are allowed. If any robot is found skeptical, it will be immediately disqualified.
            4. At any point of the time, only one robot is allowed into the arena with only one participant if necessary.
            5. The Robot must deal with lighting conditions as they appear. No changes will be made individually to any
            participant. IR focusing cameras and flash photography will be allowed unless judges deem such activities.
            6. The participant cannot change the orientation of the robot before starting the race.
            7. Judges reserve the right to ask for the explanation of the robot. Judges also reserves a right to stop a run and
            disqualify the robot.
            8. Do not make any assumptions about the amount or type of light present at the site. However, a chance for calibration
            of the sensors shall be provided.
            9. There may be alternative elimination methods in some cases. These may be posted before the race.
            10. All the robots will be racing on the same track for a given round.
            11. The number of robots qualified for the next round will be revealed prior to the contest.
            12. A maximum of four participants are allowed per team. Participants may be from different colleges as well.
            13. No team is allowed to check their robot trials on the arena. They will be provided a small flex with a circle to
            test their robot.
            14. The selection into the next round is based upon the performance (time) in the previous round.
            15. All the figures given above just denote the shape of the arena but not their dimensions.
            FAQS
            Q. What if there is any tie among the participants?
            Ans: If there is any tie between two robots then the two robots are asked to make more number of laps. Even if the tie
            doesn’t break, the previous round scores will be considered.
            Q. What if the robot exceeds size constraint?
            Ans: It will be disqualified.
            Q. What if the robot stops in the middle of the match?
            Ans: 5-minute break is given to the robot to repair and join back in the race. If not it will be disqualified.
            Q. Can you brief about the final round?
            Ans: Similar to qualifying round there will be junctions, acute angles, sharp curves, discontinuities, spaces, etc.
            The rules may be slightly modified during the competition. The organizers reserve the right for the same.
