                Awesome Racer bots made by awesome people race down the long path facing all the obstacles to reach
                their goal. The first one to reach wins! The event is conducted in several rounds. The arena can be of
                any type and it is so necessary that the robots be ready for that!
                <br>
                <h2>RULES</h2>
                Each participant has to design and build a manually controlled wired or wireless bot that is capable of
                traversing a given terrain with ease and in less time. The arena is designed to test the mobility and
                speed of the bot in various terrains.
                <br>
               <h2>Arena Specifications:</h2>
               <br>

               1. The arena will consist of the following terrains:-
               <br>
               Pebble
               <br>
               Sand
               <br>
               Water
               <br>
               Bumps
               <br>
               Wedges
               <br>
               
               2. The width of the track will be around 100 cm.
               <br>
               3. There is a provision for “pit stop” in case if the robot gets stuck at any point on the track after
               the race begins.
               <br>
               In that case participant can lift the bot up and fix and continue from the same point as noted by the
               organizer.
               <br>
               This time lapse will not be considered at any point. The race doesn’t “pause”, the opponent can continue
               the race uninterruptedly.
               <br>
               4. The participants are not allowed to touch the bot unless they take a pit stop.
               <br>
               5. One is allowed to take a maximum of 4 pit stops of 10 seconds each.
               <br>
               <br>
               <h2>General Rules:</h2>

               3. Certificate of excellence will be awarded to top three teams.
               <br>
               4. Bots should not be disassembled until the results are declared.
               <br>

               <br>
               8. The bots cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits however you can make use of readymade gear
               assemblies.
               <br>
               <br>
               <h2>Bot Specifications:</h2>
            
               1.The bot should fit in a box of dimensions 30cmsx30cmsx30cms.
               <br>
               2. The power supply used can be a maximum of 12 Volts which can either be on board or off board. IC
               Engines are not allowed.
               <br>
               3. The bot may be wired or wireless.
               <br>
               4. Sufficient wire should be brought, 3 meters minimum for wired bot.
               <br>
               5. Provision to prevent entanglement of wires should be implemented.
               <br>
               6. The wireless bot is advised to have two remote control circuits (or a dual frequency remote control
               circuit) which can be switched to either frequency before the start of the game.
               This is done to avoid frequency interference between the two competing bots during the race.
               <br>
               <h2>Event Rules:</h2>
               1. In qualifying round, the bot has to pass through maximum number of checkpoints in a given time.
               <br>
               2. Qualifications for further rounds will depend on number of participants.
               <br>
               3. Slots are made available at the beginning of the game and no changes will be made further.
               <br>
               4. There are different terrains and checkpoints through which the bot has to pass.
               <br>
               5. Various limitations to the path are made on the terrain so as to have a competition based on their
               design.
               <br>
               6. The bot completing the arena in least time will be declared as the winner.
               <br>
               7. So the participants should design their bot to suit these terrains which makes it more challenging for
               them.
               <br>
               8. Only 2 members of a team are allowed to control the bot during the race.
               <br>
               9. The teams will have to take care of their stock of batteries. Organizers are not responsible for the
               availability of the batteries near the event location.
               <br>
               10. The bot will be disqualified if any part fails or falls off in the arena and is unable to continue.
               <h2>Rounds:</h2>
               
               The event will be carried out in two rounds.

               <h2>First round</h2>
               In the first round, each bot will run individually and the points will be awarded on the basis of the
               number of checkpoints covered in the specified limit of time.
               <h2>Second round</h2>

               In the second round, two bots will compete with each other simultaneously and time taken will be
               recorded.
               <br>
               The total time taken to complete the whole circuit (single lap) will be taken into consideration and only
               three teams who will complete the arena in the least time will be selected.
               <br>
               <br>
               NOTE: The rules may be slightly modified during the competition. The organizers reserve the right for the
